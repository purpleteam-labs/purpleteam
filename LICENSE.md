# FAQ

There are 2 licenses for PurpleTeam. BSL covers our `local` environment and PCL (PurpleTeam Cloud License) 
which covers the `cloud` environment (also known as BinaryMist PurpleTeam).

1. [BSL](./licenses/bsl.md): The intent as we mentioned in our [blog post](https://binarymist.io/blog/2021/12/20/purpleteam-license-change/) 
is to allow any use of the `local` PurpleTeam environment other than 
offering PurpleTeam as a service. The license will at some point in the future (change date) become Apache 2.

2. [PCL](http://purpleteam-labs.com/publication/purpleteam-cloud-license/): PurpleTeam Cloud License - is intended to allow you to use the `cloud` environment that you pay for.

We thank Redpanda, MariaDB and CockroachDB for pioneering the use of BSL for storage systems. 
It gave us a path to build a SaaS product in the age of the hyperclouds.
